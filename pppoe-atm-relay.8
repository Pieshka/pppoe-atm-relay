.TH PPPOE-ATM-RELAY 8 "August 2025" "version 1.0" "User Manuals"

.SH NAME
pppoe-atm-relay \- relay between PPPoA and PPPoE protocols

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pppoe-atm-relay
[\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
pppoe-atm-relay is a PPP packet relay between Ethernet and ATM interfaces. It enables a completely transparent connection of PPPoE clients (e.g., routers, servers, computers) with ATM interfaces (ADSL, VDSL, DOCSIS technologies, as well as pure ATM network cards).

.br
This is not Ethernet over ATM — PPPoE frames are decapsulated into individual PPP packets and transmitted via the ATM interface and vice versa.

.SH INSTALLATION
Build the pppoe-atm-relay using \fBcmake\fR and create a service using your system's init solution (e.g., systemd, init.d).

.br
By setting the \fBAC_NAME\fR parameter in cmake or while compiling directly, you can change the AC Name presented to clients (default: "pppoe-atm-relay").

.br
pppoe-atm-relay requires a kernel with PPPoA and PPPoE support (CONFIG_PPPOE, CONFIG_PPPOATM) and at least kernel version 5.11, as it uses the PPPIOCBRIDGECHAN functionality (or backported commit from 5.11).

.SH USAGE
pppoe-atm-relay can run in foreground or background. Logs are sent to syslog, except for critical startup messages.

.SH CONNECTING WITH A CLIENT
PPPoE clients typically cannot set ATM interface parameters, so pppoe-atm-relay uses the Service-Name tag to specify the ATM interface path, channel, and encapsulation.
.br

The Service-Name tag format:
.IP
\fI<ATM interface>.<VPI>.<VCI>,<Encapsulation>\fR

where \fI<Encapsulation>\fR can be:
.RS
0 \- auto-detection
.br
1 \- VC-MUX
.br
2 \- LLC
.RE

Example: “0.0.35,2” means ATM interface 0, VPI=0, VCI=35, LLC encapsulation.

.br
pppoe-atm-relay supports RFC 4638, allowing a larger MRU than 1492. The Ethernet interface must have an increased MTU accordingly.

.br
Other PPP parameters like login or password are irrelevant; PPP packets are transparently forwarded.
